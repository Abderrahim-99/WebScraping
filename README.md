# Data Extraction / Data Analysis
Web scraping is a method used to get great amounts of data from websites and then data can be used 
for any kind of data manipulation and operation on it.
In This project we used web scraping to collect product data from [avito.ma](https://www.avito.ma/index.htm) 
and analyze it later.
